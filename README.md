# Work-day-schedule-project
In this proejct i am tasked with creating an event listener to save logged data to the local storage, and then to return it to the textbox it was written in permenanty, writing code to see if each section is either in the past, present or future hour of the day, and using this info, i add classes .past, .present, .future to each section accordingly. Also, I am tasked with adding the current date to the header of this document.  This project is meant to test my knowledge on using jquery and dayjs, 2 of the third party API's we have studied over the past week.
